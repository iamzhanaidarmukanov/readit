This is a simple Full Stack Application to achieve a goal of learning a MERN stack as well as building an application to track the books that I am reading and already completed since it is hard to have a track of all books that I am having my hands on. It is going to be a fun project.

For the development of the application I am using a MERN stack which stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS.
